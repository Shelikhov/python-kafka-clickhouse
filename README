#=======================================================

1. To create a service that generates data in the format with a frequency of 1s (as example):
timestamp: unix timestamp
bid_01: float - random number from 1 to 10
bid_02: float - random number from 1 to 20
bid_50: float - random number from 1 to 500
ask_01: float - random number from 1 to 10
ask_02: float - random number from 1 to 20
ask 50: float - random number from 1 to 500
stats: json - json with average for all bids and average for all ask

The data should be sent to the Apache Kafka.

Service that generates data:
GitLab/docker-context/app.py

Infrastructure (IaC directory):
Minikube - is an orchestrator to manage Service (Python script).
Kafka - is a broker for data generated from Service.
Clickhouse - is a database to store received data from the Kafka Broker.

GitLab directory - to build and deploy python application on the Minikube located in AWS.
